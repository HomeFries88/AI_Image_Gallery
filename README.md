# 📷 AI Image Gallery Manager

An end to end **AI Powered Image Classification and Gallery Management Application** build with **Streamlit** and **Tensorflow (MobileNetV2)**.
This project allows users to upload multiple images, automatically classify them using a pre-trained deep learning model, organize them into a searchable gallery, and export AI generated files into a csv file.

This repository is used to demonstrate **practical machine learning integration**, **clean application architecture**, and **user focused UI design**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **AI Image Gallery Manager** is a web-based application that:

* Accepts **multiple image uploads**
* Uses a **pre-trained convolutional neural network (MoblileNetV2)** to classify images
* Automatically assigns **AI generated tags**
* Stores images and predictions into an interactive gallery
* Allows **searching images by AI tags**
* Exports classification results to **csv** for futher analysis

The project emphasizes:

* Real world ML inference
* Efficient state management in Streamlit
* Scalable, modular Python code
* Clear separation of concerns (model loading, pre-processing, and user interface)
